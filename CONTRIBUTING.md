# Contributing

This project is in early MVP stage. The most valuable contributions right now are **usage reports**, not code.

## What We Need

### Try It and Report Back

1. Drop `CLAUDE.md` into a real project
2. Use Claude Code for actual work
3. Tell us what happened:
   - What worked?
   - What got ignored?
   - What was missing?
   - What did you have to modify?

Open an issue with the label `usage-report`.

### Share Your Modifications

If you customized `CLAUDE.md` for your context and it worked well, share it:
- What did you add?
- What did you remove?
- Why?

This helps us understand what the core should include vs. what's project-specific.

## What We're NOT Looking For (Yet)

- CLI tooling
- Fancy features
- Automation

We're validating the core premise first: does a simple CLAUDE.md meaningfully change agent behavior?

Once that's proven, we'll build more.

## Code of Conduct

Be kind. Be helpful. Assume good intent.
